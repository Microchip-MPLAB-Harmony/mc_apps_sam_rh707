# PMSM FOC using PLL Estimator

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with PLL Estimator based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a SAMRH707 Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using PLL estimator technique. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope. 


Key features enabled in this project are:

- Dual shunt current measurement
- Speed control loop
- Field weakening


## MHC Project Configurations

- **ADC**: 

   ADC is hardware triggered from PWM at the end of each PWM cycle. It coverts phase U current, phase V current, DC bus voltage and potentiometer.

   Conversion Ready interrupt is generated by ADC. 

- **PWM0**: 

    This peripheral is used to generated three phase synchronous PWM waveforms. Fault functionality is also enabled to switch off the output waveforms asynchronously.

- **X2CScope**: 

    This component adds X2C scope protocol code. This uses UART to communicate to the host PC. X2CScope allows user to monitor variables runtime.
- **FLEXCOM1 Peripheral**: 

    The UART is used for X2CScope communication to observe graphs and variable values in run time
